  An externally tuned version of Schedule Free AdamW ([Defazio et al., 2024](https://openreview.net/forum?id=0XeNkkENuI)) with a list of five hyperparameter configurations. It is a weighted dual-averaging version of Schedule-Free, which shows improved convergence over the unweighted version on some workloads, particularly ViT.
