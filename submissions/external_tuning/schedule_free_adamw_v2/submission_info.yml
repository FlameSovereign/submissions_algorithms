  An externally tuned version of Schedule Free AdamW ([Defazio et al., 2024](https://openreview.net/forum?id=0XeNkkENuI)) with a list of five hyperparameter configurations. Version 2.0 uses slightly different hyperparameter configurations. It also makes use of the batch-norm fixes made after the competition deadline, and which follows the published version of Schedule-Free in a few small details for consistency.
