  A self-tuning version of Schedule Free AdamW ([Defazio et al., 2024](https://openreview.net/forum?id=0XeNkkENuI)) using a single hyperparameter configuration. Version 2.0 makes use of the batch-norm fixes made after the competition deadline, and which follows the published version of Schedule-Free in a few small details for consistency.
